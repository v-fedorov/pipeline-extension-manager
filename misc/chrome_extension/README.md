# Coveo extension manager
Manages and helps test pipeline extensions. With this extension, you can quickly add an extension from an existing gallery that gets updated then test it right after with any document avaible in the organization. This improves how quickly one can test extensions and find mistakes.

## Install

If you are on Coveo domain, you can install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tester-for-indexing-pipel/gbaapjhekfgfnjkijijdfkllbfhobieb?hl=en-US).

## Description
This extension has 2 parts to it:
1. The extensions gallery
2. The extension tester

### The gallery
The extension gallery can be found when one clicks on the "Add Extension" button in the top right of the extensions page.
This is what is looks like:

When clicked on, a Coveo seach pops up with a list of available extensions. The extensions are added by the python script portion of the repo.

change where where the content is being taken. Head to chrome://extensions/ and click on the options dialog.

### The tester

## Notes
The tester is only capable of getting indexed metadata, Body Text, Body HTML and Thumbnail.
Some metadata only exists when a real extension is being ran, so results may vary.
So in some cases, it's better to test with re-building a source.

It is currently not possible to test with a datastream in prod. The next rollout (August 5th, 2017) will allow this feature to work.

This was tested on Chromium 58.0 running Ubuntu 16.04

No additional support will be provided by the Coveo-Labs team
