## Notes

The tester is only capable of getting indexed metadata, Body Text, Body HTML and Thumbnail.
Some metadata only exists when a real extension is being ran, so results may vary.
So in some cases, it's better to test with re-building a source.

No additional support will be provided by the Coveo-Labs team.
